This undocumented contents is left as it. It is part of an in-development project about FO-LTL, its syntax, semantics and transformations preserving satisfiability. Proofs referenced by CAV paper are tagged 'Paper' in the Coq source code. The 'make' command compiles all the files.

* abstraction.v: transformation removing universal quantifiers under existential quantifiers
  
* cextension.v: extension of signature by new constants
* dec.v: composition of decidable types
* finite.v: composition of finite types
* elimeq.v: abstraction eliminating equalities
* env.v: environment management fonctions
* foltl.v: FO-LTL syntax and semantics
* fosem.v: some semantic results about FO-LTL 
* hdex.v: a finite model property
* instanciation.v: sat preservation by forall instanciation
* propagation.v: abstraction of closure operation
* quantifiers.v: top quantifier extraction
* set.v: set library
* skolem.v: skolemisation
* stability.v: soundness of stability criteria
* subItp.v: relation between interpretations
* utils.v: various list utility fonctions
