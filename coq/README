* finite.v: composition of finite types
* elimeq.v: abstraction eliminating equalities
* env.v: environment management fonctions
* foltl.v: FO-LTL syntax and semantics
* fosem.v: some semantic results about FO-LTL 
* hdex.v: a finite model property
* instanciation.v: sat preservation by forall instanciation
* propagation.v: abstraction of closure operation
* quantifiers.v: top quantifier extraction
* set.v: set library
